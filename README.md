  <p>Something that exists uniquely amongst its many similarities is considered a singularity. These occurrences are found everywhere throughout existence.</p>
  <p>An entity that exists amongst its peers who are similar in characteristics is considered a singularity. Even though it may look similar it carries unique unseen traits its peers could never imagine.</p>
  <p>On that note, you as a user of this extensive platform are a singularity and we use yet another singularity to identify you and all singularities you generate.</p>
